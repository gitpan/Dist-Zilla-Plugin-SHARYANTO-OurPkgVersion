NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SHARYANTO::OurPkgVersion - no line insertion and
    does Package version with our

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    in dist.ini

            [SHARYANTO::OurPkgVersion]

    in your modules

            # VERSION

    or

            our $VERSION = '0.123'; # VERSION

DESCRIPTION
    This module is like Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion but can replace
    the previously generated "our $VERSION = '0.123'; " bit. If the author
    of OurPkgVersion thinks this is a good idea, then perhaps this module
    will be merged with OurPkgVersion.
